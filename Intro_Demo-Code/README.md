# Amiga Intro/Demo code
Amiga Intro/Demo code written 68000 Assembly around 1986~1988, on the Amiga 500.
<br>
Some of the code was found hiding on old floppy discs, whilst others have been reverse engineered.
<br>
Minor updates have been made as the code didn't run on my A1200 and didn't correctly free up the system resources on shutdown.
<br>

The image below shows the Hawkeye intro. This intro was written to show off Markers pixel skills.
<br>
Minor code updates have been made to the fader routine as it kept crashing on the A1200.
